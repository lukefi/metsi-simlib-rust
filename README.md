# Metsi simulation library as Rust

Recreation of https://github.com/lukefi/metsi simulation core as a Rust library.

Development halted in favour of https://github.com/lukefi/metsi-simlib-cpp C++ implementation.

# Getting started

* Obtain Rust. Suggestion is to use https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install for toolchain management. This project targets the Stable build.
* Windows users need to obtain the MSVC CLI tools by using the Visual Studio Installer. Rustup on windows will suggest installing Visual Studio Community Edition.
* Open this repository in the IDE or editor of your choosing. IntelliJ IDEA works brilliantly with Rust. Visual Studio Code should have sufficient Rust extensions.

# Helpful commands
